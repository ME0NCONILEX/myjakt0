# mynewjakt0servform

Att the last...

At the beginning I have to say that I've built this applet from scratch (first with spring && react.js && php and finally built as "All in one" in only react.js with Node.js, mysql dbase && php) but of course that as a beginner in javapprogramming I have gradually sneaked in ideas from the internet's different sources.

In the absence of any guidance and without any detailed introductory tasks, I have built this little program entirely alone.
The program is not intended for production, it is not completed at all. 
In this last video (the fourth) I made a little more detailed account of some of my ideas, of the little program that I have built entirely at home on my private computer.
In addition to these videos in a couple of month, I have delivered to my colleagues several tips, ideas and advice.
Applet is still under construction and can safely contain different kinds of errors.
This is one of several reasons for I won't share anything more than this video.
(By the way, initially, Klas has mentioned that they already have a ready-to-go solution...)

I hope You are satisfied with this presentation and, moreover, you will hopefully be able to use some of the tips of the presentation in any way. Thank you for your attention and durability!

I did it, You can do it...
